Once the repository is duplicated do this:
Install Nodemon unless it's already installed.
Open a second instance of the terminal to make things easier.
In one terminal navigate to the test folder (cd client then cd test)
Once in the test folder type in (yarn install)
Now for the second terminal navigate to the api folder (cd api)
Once in the api folder type in (nodemon index.js) to run the backend.
Lastly go back to the first terminal and type in (yarn start) to run the frontend.
